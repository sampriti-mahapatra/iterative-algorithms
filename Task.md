# Task: Optimization Algorithms

You are required to implement the **Steepest Descent** and **Newtonâ€™s Method** algorithms to find a local minimum of the given functions. Each function should have its own program, starting from the specified initial point. The implementations must include routines for computing the gradient, Hessian, step size (using exact line search), and descent direction, along with necessary checks for potential issues such as division by zero. Both a stopping criterion and a reasonable iteration bound should be included.

For each algorithm, the output should report the local minimum found, the function value at that point, and the norm of the gradient. Additionally, a table should be generated (up to 20 iterations) with iteration number, current point, function value, gradient, gradient norm, and step size.
